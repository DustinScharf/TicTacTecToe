## How does a TicTacTecToe game work?
First Select a game mode and the game will start.

![This is a Demo GIF, alternatively read the tutorial below](gameDemo.gif "An example game versus a bot")

1. **Selection Phase** <br>
Select a PLACER, the player sending the higher PLACER starts this round<br>
PLACERs are the numbers above / below the 3x3 board

2. **Place Phase** <br>
Select a PLACER by a click, and place it on the board<br>
Placing is possible on an empty field or a field with a lower placer on it

3. **Win Check** <br>
If a player hits 3 PLACERS in a row (like normal TicTacToe) the players wins <br>
If a player can not set anything, the other player wins <br>
If none of them holds, the selection phase starts again
